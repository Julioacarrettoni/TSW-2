# Try Swift World
Workshop on [Try Swift World¹](https://www.tryswift.co/world/) about introducing [Combine²](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/combine) into a UIKit based app

## Introducing your UIKit app to Combine

Now that combine is more stable and mature and with over 80% of iOS devices running it, is time to start adopting it. We will take a provided sample application written in UIKit and add some new features to it using Combine without having to refactor the whole codebase. Step by step we can make our existing applications more reactive and testable.

This repository contains the sample code used in the workshop as well as the keynote presentation.
Solutions for the exercises can be found in separated [pull requests³](https://github.com/Julioacarrettoni/TSW-2/pulls).

If you are here preparing for the workshop download the code and make sure you can compile and run the sample app, if you can, don't look at the solutions just yet to not spoil yourself. But if you do and you are familiar with Combine, feel free to prepare a couple of questions to bring up during the workshop.

Feel free to reach for me [on twitter⁴](https://twitter.com/dev_jac) if you have questions, comments or you would like to discuss a portion of the code.
You can also fork and send back pull request with your proposed solutions if you would like to discuss it over the PR or in private.
